                <h3>Avid I-Con </h3>
                <p>Post Production offers the complete spectrum of mastering and versioning services for all types of film and television projects, from airlines versioning to foreign language mastering. Our highly experienced teams can support virtually any need, including creative editorial, sound restoration, audio and video layback, quality assurance, conversions, encoding, transfer, duplication and archiving. Exceptional expertise coupled with advanced tools combine to ensure the very highest quality.
 Post Production is leading the way in digital workflows and media processing with state-of-the-art technologies. Sony Pictures was an early adopter of Interoperable Master Format (IMF) mastering and was one of the first Post Production facilities to operationalize IMF workflows. IMF is a standardized format that allows for the exchange of motion picture and television content between devices and facilities. Conceived to eventually replace video tape as a mastering format, IMF is a collection of file-based assets (picture, audio, text, files and metadata) designed to play together through one or more Composition Play Lists. The Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers (SMPTE) standardized the basic format in 2012 which is supported by a growing number of studios, broadcasters, manufacturers and vendors.
Because IMF is a component-based format and stores the difference between versions (instead of flattened linear versions), it brings significant cost savings and greatly improved efficiency in the post production workflow. It is revolutionizing the digital media supply chain by streamlining the mastering process and allowing quick time-to-market.</p>
